# Apple-Music-CRUD-Database

This project is a Python application inspired by Apple Music that allows users to manage their music collection using a MySQL database.

# Features:

Database Management: Utilizes a MySQL database (not included in this project) to store music information.
Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): An ER diagram is provided to visualize the relationships between different data entities (e.g., songs, artists, albums).
SQL Queries: Leverages SQL queries for interacting with the MySQL database, enabling data manipulation within the music library.
CRUD Operations: Implements functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting music entries within the library.
Requirements:

Python (version X.X or later recommended) - https://www.python.org/downloads/
MySQL Database Server - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ (Please install and configure MySQL separately.)
Note:

This project provides the core functionalities for managing a music library with MySQL. You'll need to configure the connection details to your specific MySQL instance within the Python code.
